## On the timeline

2004-2008 : **IIT Kanpur ( Bachelors in Biosciences & Bio-Enginnering )**, Made lifelong friends, A time I can live thousands time over.

2008 (July)-2009(November) : Worked as **Credit Risk Analyst with Global Analytics** ( Chennai ). Good times and Bad times, got curious about using Machine Learning to solve business problems and  then decided to leave. Oh! the freedom to be stupid enough to take risks without caring about consequences or any plan.

2009 (November)-2010 (July): Made plans to conquer the world, failed .  Joining Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata would be the next step.

2010 (July)-2012(March) : **ISI Kolkata (Masters in Operations Research)** Fell in love with statistics and everything ML. Met one of the most amazing people and more friends , yay!

2011 (?) - 2013 (June) : Learned a valuable lesson : you can tell the world that your business failed because of failure to raise money, however you most certainly lacked necessary skills to make it successful. Much needed humbling experience ( forced to shutdown two companies ! )

2013 (July) : Launched **[Edvancer](https://www.edvancer.in){:target="_blank"}** with [Aatash Shah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aatashshah/){:target="_blank"} , online courses on Machine Learning with SAS (We have long since moved on to R, Python and other open source tools)

2014 : Launched Courses with R. SAS demand was going down fast by this time, Started taking ML, DL sessions for various corporate clients. eClerx, Mumbai was our first client

2015 : Launched our first course using Python

2015-2018 (August) : Various online courses using R, Python, SQL, Tableau, Hadoop have been added to catalog by now( ML, DL, Big data, NLP with both live online classes as well as self paced options)

2018 (August) : Finally relented and launched classroom sessions @Hyderabad with a 6 month long comprehensive program ( covering ML, DL, Big data, SQL, Tableau)

2019 (July) : Launched classroom programs @Mumbai & @Delhi after overwhelming response in Hyderabad. We have completed 100+ sessions on ML/DL/Stats topics across multiple companies (Deloitte, EY, Genpact, GE, Colpal, PWC, HDFC have been one of the frequent clients that I keep on visiting)
